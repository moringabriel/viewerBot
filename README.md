# viewerBot
Creation of an automated process to open and close repetitively a specified URL to generate views.

The idea for this script was in priority to practise and develop python knowledge.

During my university study with a team of artists we made a short 30 seconds movie that was published on Twitter and YouTube. On Twitter it attracted a lot of views. But on YouTube it didn't pickup as much. I wondered if viewing the video many times would attract more views and create an interested boost so YouTube can promote are short film.

To test this idea out, I coded a simple script that open and close a specified URL repetitively with a time delay.

The development was educative but it actually does not work. What I learned from this exploration was that YouTube temporary compiles the additional number of  views but after a certain time, they will filter out any views that are repetitively coming from the same ip address.
